# LabVIEW-to-UML
Tool to export LabVIEW projects to UML, with class relationships, methods, and data members.

This is a fork of LabVIEW-Class-Project-Plant-UML project from Piotr Kruczkowski (@Primary-Key) that I pretend to modify
to give more UML class information and also more export options than the UML code.

## Milestones

- [x] Fork, update, and tidy up repository
- [ ] Get class data members
- [ ] Get PNG output
- [ ] Get SVG output
- [ ] New GUI and error checking the path before processing
